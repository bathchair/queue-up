#### Instructions for use: 
Once the repository has been cloned and opened in Android Studio, please select any emulator you wish to use (Pixel 3 is recommended, but not required) and execute the app. </br>

Upon launch, you will be presented with our screen template, which consists of the top and bottom navigation bars with a blank app body. <br/> 

The "queue/search" button (center button on the bottom navigation bar) will take you to our Search page. Here, you can select any game you wish to filter by (you will need to scroll down), as well as the rank you wish to filter with if applicable, and press the circular "Search" button at the top of the page. The location and age sliders do have functionality, but do not display values at this moment in time. Once you click the "Search" button, you will be taken to our pre-generated user profile for Ludwig. You can view Ludwig's different profile pictures but clicking the left and right arrows in the carousel component, and you can also view Ludwig's profile description, age, location, pronouns, and the applicable filter arguments (assuming you selected League of Legends and Gold, of course). There is also a "Message" button on Ludwig's profile page, which brings us to our next feature. <br/> 

The "chat" button (second from the right in the bottom navigation bar) will bring you to our messaging page, wherein you can select the pregenerated conversation to see how a fully integrated chat feature would funciton in our app. <br/> 

Lastly, the profile button (the far right button in the bottom navigation bar) will bring you to your very own (pre-generatd) user profile. You can cycle through your own profile pictures with the arrow buttons in the carosel, very similary to how it functioned on Ludwig's profile page, as well as view all of the aforementioned profile information for Ludwig but for your own profile. What differs about your own profile page, however, is the ability to add a game to your list of games. If you click the "+" button in the games section of the profile, you will be given a list of games to choose from. Upon selecting one, it will be added to your profile. </br> 

Once you are finished, the "Home" button (the far left button on the bottom navigation bar) will take you back to the original launch screen. </br> 

Thank you for using QueueUp! </br>
